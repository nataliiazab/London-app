        <p>
          When we think of London what comes to our mind is London bridge,
          London eye, various museums, Madame Tussads and so on which are in
          central part of London . But London is not just the central London;
          its suburbs have a lot to offer too. Places like Harrow in the
          North-west corner of London, Sutton to the South and Lewisham in
          South-east are some of London’s hidden gems.

          Outside of central London, Harrow has the most number of museums in
          the city. London motorcycle museum, RAF museum and Harrow museum are
          just a few of them. Heath Robinson museum in Harrow displays the works
          of William Heath Robinson, a well known humorist and illustrator, and
          there are rotating exhibits dedicated to other influential artists.
          The Harrow arts centre is a premier centre for culture in Harrow and
          besides being a performance venue, the Grade II listed building is a
          wonder of architecture and worth seeing on its own. Harrow on the hill
          is a historic village located in Harrow and rises 408 feet above sea
          level and is crowned by St Mary’s church from the 11th century. The
          hill with its little shops, tearooms, pubs and quaint shopping streets
          is charming and delightful. It is also home to the esteemed Harrow
          public school which is one of the oldest independent boarding school.
          The school’s buildings are Grade listed and available for the public
          to tour three times a year.

          Sutton, the southern edge of Greater London, has been inhabited for
          centuries and is one of London’s greenest boroughs. Sutton is bisected
          by the River Wandle and has many parks. Wandle trail is a 12.5 mile
          long trail starting from Croydon to the mouth. Wandle flows through
          seven different parks and wilderness areas in the Borough of Sutton
          alone and Beddington park is one of them. Beddington park is valued as
          one of the most archeologically significant places in London and comes
          under a conservation area. Honeywood museum is the main museum for the
          London borough of Sutton and is located in a sumptuous house at
          Carshalton ponds. The Whitehall in Cheam village is a gorgeous
          weatherboard house that has a history going back to 16th century and
          is now a museum open for free on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. The

          to Brighton turnpike. Little Holland House in carshalton village is a
          Grade II listed and features handmade furniture and copperwork by
          craftsman and owner, Frank Dickinson. it is a wonderful example of the
          arts and crafts movement.
